# H2-O2-production-analysis

Exploratory data analysis of hydrogen and oxygen production data using Python and pandas.

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hydrogen and oxygen
production data obtained from Kaggle. The objective is to understand production
trends over time and analyze the relationship between hydrogen and oxygen output.

## Dataset
The dataset contains time-based production values for:
- Hydrogen (H2)
- Oxygen (O2)
- Combined H2–O2 production volume

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis
- Time-based trends of hydrogen and oxygen production
- Comparison of total H2–O2 production with individual gas production
- Calculation and analysis of O2 to H2 production ratio

## Key Insights
- Hydrogen and oxygen production show consistent trends over time
- Total production closely reflects individual gas outputs
- The O2/H2 ratio remains relatively stable, indicating steady process behavior

## Repository Structure
- `H2_O2_Analysis.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis
- `H2_O2_production` : Dataset used for the analysis
